Initial work done on June 21st, 2016.

This set of analyses expects to have a directory of data sibling but not within it.  This is bacause many of the data files are too large to include in the repository.

Some output files may also be external to this directory, although all can be generated by the code here.

The main analyses are all run via the R markdown file called "tues-pm-func.Rmd".
